        Protecting Ghana’s Cocoa Children: Insights from an Endline Evaluation
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Ghana’s cocoa industry is not only central to the economy, but also to the lives of millions of families. Yet, the sector faces ongoing challenges around child labor and child protection, especially in rural communities. That’s why Fairtrade Africa (FTA) launched the Dignity For All (D4A) Child Protection Project, aiming to strengthen community awareness, improve reporting systems, and ensure children’s rights are respected.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-700 mt-8 mb-2">About the Evaluation</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Development Change Hub (DCH) was engaged by Fairtrade Africa to conduct the <b>endline evaluation</b> of the D4A Child Protection Project in selected cocoa-growing districts. This evaluation focused on identifying what changed for children and communities as a result of the project, what worked well, and what remains to be addressed for future progress.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-700 mt-8 mb-2">Highlights & Lessons Learned</h2>
      <ul className="mb-4 text-gray-700 list-disc pl-5">
        <li className="mb-2">
          <b>Community-Led Change:</b> The evaluation found that local committees and champions played a crucial role in raising awareness and supporting safer environments for children. As a result, more families and community members became active in identifying and addressing child protection issues.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <b>Empowering Children and Adults:</b> Children and caregivers alike reported better knowledge of their rights, where to seek help, and how to report cases of abuse or exploitation. These improvements point to the value of community training, ongoing sensitization, and open dialogue.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Sustaining the Impact:</b> While notable gains were observed, the evaluation also identified ongoing challenges—such as limited resources and the need for stronger government partnerships. Continued investment and community involvement will be key to long-term change.
        </li>
      </ul>

    The Human Side of the Sahel Crisis—Resilience in Ghana’s Border Communities
  </h2>
  <p className="mb-3 text-gray-700">
    In recent years, communities along Ghana’s northern border experienced the ripple effects of instability in the Sahel region. As displaced families crossed the border in search of safety, local residents stepped up to offer shelter and support, often stretching their own limited resources to help.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-3 text-gray-700">
    Host families opened their doors and shared what they could, despite facing their own economic challenges. The humanitarian response was shaped not just by aid agencies, but by the resilience and compassion shown by these border communities. Their willingness to support displaced people, especially women and children, underscored the strength of social ties in the face of adversity.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-3 text-gray-900 font-semibold">
    Key lesson: Long-term solutions for border communities required not only external assistance, but also investment in the social infrastructure that enabled these communities to respond and adapt.

    Strengthening Ghana’s SME Sector: Lessons from Field Engagement
  </h2>
  <p className="mb-3 text-gray-700">
    In 2024, our team worked with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across Ghana to identify obstacles and co-create solutions for business growth. Through a series of field visits and collaborative workshops, we learned that access to finance and reliable market information remained core challenges.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-3 text-gray-700">
    Despite these barriers, Ghanaian entrepreneurs consistently demonstrated adaptability and resourcefulness. Their drive to innovate—whether by adopting new digital tools or forming strategic partnerships—was a key factor in business resilience.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-3 text-gray-900 font-semibold">
    Key lesson: Building sustainable SME growth requires hands-on support, knowledge sharing, and policies that reflect the lived realities of entrepreneurs on the ground.
